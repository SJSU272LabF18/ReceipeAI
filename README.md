## Project Ideas

### Idea 1: Speech driven self-driving car simulator
** Project Description: **

Using open source tools such as Udacity’s self driving car simulator we propose to create a self driving car that could take voice commands to take directional input and drive accordingly. The project will consist of two parts: the creation of a self driving car and its environment, and the speech recognition. The project will enable us to control a simulated car in real time that could drive based on human voice input without compromising traffic laws or critical failures. 

** Methodology ** 

- Use SpeechRecognition library in Python to process voice commands
- Use Udacity's Self Driving Car simulator in Python to create a self driving car and a simulated environment 
- Use Google Maps API to set routes and get ETA estimates
