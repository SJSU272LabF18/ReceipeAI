## Project Ideas

### Idea 1: Speech driven self-driving car simulator
__Project Description:__

Using open source tools such as Udacity’s self driving car simulator we propose to create a self driving car that could take voice commands to take directional input and drive accordingly. The project will consist of two parts: the creation of a self driving car and its environment, and the speech recognition. The project will enable us to control a simulated car in real time that could drive based on human voice input without compromising traffic laws or critical failures. 

__Methodology:__ 

- Use SpeechRecognition library in Python to process voice commands
- Use Udacity's Self Driving Car simulator in Python to create a self driving car and a simulated environment 
- Use Google Maps API to set routes and get ETA estimates 

### Idea 2: Apple Watch OCD/Habit Helper

__Project Description:__

OCD/health app using machine learning and Apple Watch/health tracker to figure out when the person was repeatedly doing a task to then have the app learn their habits and help them. This would use motion tracking to look for fidgeting and pattern movements. Also need to include ways to help a person with OCD to curb their habit. 

__Methodology:__
- Swift 
- Core Motion library
- Cloud based
- SQL, Hadoop, CockroachDB

### Idea 3: Recipe AI

__Project Description:__ 
Use image processing to capture images of ingredients and come up with recipes. This project consists of using a camera to capture images of ingredients, image processing to determine the ingredient, and filtering through recipes to find the closest matching for the user. To save recipes we can create a database for future referencing along with user accounts.

__Methodology:__
- Python
- Scikit
- Numpy
- Sql, CockroachDB, Hadoop/
